# Seaborn_Practice
This repository contains my practice work with Seaborn, a Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It includes various plots, datasets, and code examples to explore statistical data visualization techniques. The goal is to improve my skills in creating insightful and aesthetically pleasing charts using Seaborn.
