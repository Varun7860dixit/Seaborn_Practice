<h1>Seaborn Practice ðŸ“Š</h1>
<p>This repository is dedicated to practicing and exploring Seaborn, a powerful Python library built on Matplotlib for data visualization. The goal is to understand different plotting techniques, customize visual styles, and effectively analyze data through compelling visual representations.</p>
<br>
<h3>ðŸ”¹ What This Repository Covers</h3>
1. In-depth exploration of Seaborn functions<br>
2. Creating statistical visualizations for better data insights<br>
3. Customizing themes, color palettes, and styles to enhance plots<br>
4. Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using various Seaborn techniques<br>
5. Generating different chart types including:<br>
  *  Scatter plots<br>
  *  Line plots<br>
  *  Bar plots<br>
  *  Box plots<br>
  *  Violin plots<br>
  *  Heatmaps<br>
